# MultiMedia Experience
## Unity Showcase/portefolio
By using unity i will be showing off the products I created this semester for Multimedia. This will combine everything into one product. And make the experience a interactive one. Just walk around and explore.

## 3dBlender Model
The 3dModel was made in blender, the tool is great to design models for games and sculpting, also for making models for 3d printing. Especially for making models that are not geometrical in shape, this is where tools like SketchUp are not feasible to use. Blender does have a very high learning curve. The tools shortcuts are not intuitive and are required to make models. 

## LifeHackVideo
The video embedding doesn't work for the online unity application. The local build will work with the video you can also see the video online on youtube. The video's are made in Davinci resolve, filmed and filmed on my smartphone. It is based on Tasty Video's found on youtube and facebook
